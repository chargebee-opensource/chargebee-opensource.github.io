<p>Our customers are global, diverse (SaaS, eCommerce &amp; Services) and come across interesting use cases faster than us. We constantly incorporate these use cases to improve our product but some features are prioritized over others based on the number of requests, bandwidth etc.</p>

<p>A fast growing startup has itâ€™s own will. It requires feature enhancements that goes over &amp; beyond standard features. The features should not only address requirements specific to the business but also be executed ASAP (like yesterday!). When implemented, they can play a pivotal role in taking the business to new heights or in simply making things a lot easier. </p>

<p>We wanted to step out of the way, give you the flexibility to include any feature you like and let you take full control. Additionly, our partners and customers also made contributions and thus came about the open source initiative. </p>
